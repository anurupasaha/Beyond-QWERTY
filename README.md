Project Title: Beyond QWERTY: Form Filling&#39;s Vernacular Voyage with Voice
Versatility!

Project Statement:
The project aims to revolutionize form-filling processes by going beyond the
traditional QWERTY keyboard and leveraging the capabilities of GPT and Azure
OpenAI. The solution will be designed to assist frontline workers (FLWs) in the field
by overcoming language barriers, reducing the time required for workflows, and
increasing productivity. The solution is adaptable for other purposes such as opening
bank accounts, creating digital identities, and any task requiring form filling, providing
an accessible and user-friendly interface for tasks that previously relied on text-
based input.
